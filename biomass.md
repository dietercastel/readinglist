# Biomass in short

- 20 years of (unlikely) regrowing forest required to counteract the C02 emissions
- Often doesn't take into account negative feedback loops (that would require massive negative C02 emissions to counter)
- Forests are invaluable ecosystems
- [Belgium](https://github.com/newclearenergy/readinglist/tree/master/belgium) has a notorious untouched 'forest' fund with promises of planting trees but no location or action in doing so.
- [Denmark]() gets close to 60% of their energy from biomass.
